Additional information for Transport Tycoon Deluxe
--------------------------------------------------

Network 2-player game
---------------------
  To use this feature, your network must support the IPX
(Internetwork Packet Exchange) protocol.
  To set up a 2-player game over a network, one player should
select "Network - IPX protocol (sender)", and the other player
should select "Network - IPX protocol (receiver)" in the "Link
Method" selection box in the 2-player link setup window. Both
players then click on the "Attempt Connection" bar, and once
the connection is made, play proceeds in the same way as the
serial or modem linked 2-player game.

AUTOSAVE saved-game files
-------------------------
  Normally, if the 'AUTOSAVE' option is on (see the manual
for details), the game will save regularly to a saved-game
file named "AUTOSAVE" in the Transport Tycoon Deluxe directory
of your hard disk. However, if you change the directory or
drive on the "Load Game" or "Save Game" window, then autosave
will save the game to the last selected drive and directory.
For example, if you loaded a saved-game from a floppy disk
by selecting "A:" in the "Load Game" window, then when autosave
operates, it will try to save the "AUTOSAVE" saved-game file to
floppy disk.

Windows 95 and the System Agent (supplied with Microsoft Plus!)
---------------------------------------------------------------
  Task-switching out of Transport Tycoon Deluxe while it is
running in MS-DOS from Windows 95 can cause problems with some
machines. When running Transport Tycoon Deluxe from Windows 95,
it is recommended that the screensaver is disabled (since
Windows 95 does not detect activity in MS-DOS applications, and
can make the screensaver cut in even when the game is being
played).
  Similarly, if the "System Agent", as supplied in the "Plus!"
package for Windows 95, is installed, it may be necessary to
disable it to prevent any of the system utilities (Compression
Agent, ScanDisk, etc) from running while the game is running.
To do this, select "Suspend System Agent" from the "Advanced"
menu of the System Agent window.
